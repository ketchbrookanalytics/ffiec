## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of a package that has not yet been on CRAN.; the initial three attempts were rejected. In this version I have made the following changes to the package's `DESCRIPTION` file:

* Fixed misspelled word in the `Description` section: "interace" --> "interface"
* Fixed formatting of web reference to the official API documentation in the `Description` section

Please note that I am intending to name the package 'ffiec', and the name of the organization that publishes the REST API is also "FFIEC".
