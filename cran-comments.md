## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of a package that has not yet been on CRAN.; the initial two attempts were rejected. In this version I have made the following changes to the package's `DESCRIPTION` file:

* Wrapped names of organizations and acronyms in single quotes in `Title` and `Description` sections.
* Added a web reference for the official API documentation to the in the `Description` section. The web reference is in the form `<[https:.....]https:.....>`, has no space after 'https' and is surrounded by angle brackets.

Please note that I am intending to name the package 'ffiec', and the name of the organization that publishes the REST API is also "FFIEC".
